# RMM-research

This repository has all the workings of the Primitive research for Replicating Market Makers. This work is primarily managed by Primitives Head of Research [0xEstelle](https://github.com/0xEstelle), and [0xJepsen](https://github.com/0xJepsen). Because we believe in public open source work, we intend to upload all work to this repository.

## Research Objectives

The objective of our work is to conduct peer reviewed research on the on-chain pay-off space with minimized trust dependencies. 

## Project Management

The proccess of choosing a research direction will be primarily governed by the Primitive Team. When concluding a project 0xEstelle and 0xJepsen will draft 2-5 research preposals which will be presented to the Primitive Team to arrive at consensus. From which 0xEstelle and 0xJepsen work on the chossen preposals. 

## Library

Aimed at distilling complex topics for the average user, the library will be an archive of learning resources. This will be aimed at users who have little or no prior knowledge on Calculus, Options, and other topics essential to the Primitive products. As part of the library review proccess we aspire to gather feedback from valuable community members and the primitive team to identify the most critical areas to provide higher quality information. 

## Blue Sky Work 

Blue Sky Work is rsearch oriented to exploring other tangentily related research in the Defi and Distributed Ledger space. 0xEstelle and 0xJepsen aim to spend 5h/week on this work. This has a long term positive impact on the Primitive research team as it deepens out overall understanding and opens us up to perspective and understandings that we didnt have before. Blue Sky work will be focused on innovation and learning.
